                    <p>Originally created as a basketball shoe, the Converse All-Star was the first shoe to ever be endorsed by a celebrity athlete—in this case, the 1920s basketball player Charles ‘Chuck’ Taylor.</p>
                    <p>Though originally an elite sports shoe—the official shoe of the Olympic games from 1936 to 1968, the official athletic training shoe of young American soldiers during World War 2, and worn by ninety percent of high school, college and professional basketball players by the 1960s—they lost traction to newer technologies in the 1970s, eventually regaining popularity in the 1980s as casual,retro-style footwear.</p>
                    <p>By the 90s, Chucks had become the shoe of choice among subcultures, artists and musicians, symbolizing a timeless can-do attitude and epitomizing mercurial reinvention on one’s own terms.</p>

                    <p class="p1">In January 2013, Converse announced plans for a new headquarters building. It was constructed near North Station in downtown Boston, on the Lovejoy Wharf, overlooking the Charles River as part of a major site overhaul and restoration of public waterfront access.The 10-story 214,000-square-foot (19,900 m2) office building includes a permanent music recording studio for the new "Converse Rubber Tracks" project, 5,000-square-foot (460 m2) gym with a separate yoga studio designed in partnership with Nike, and a new 3,500-square-foot (330 m2) retail Flagship Store</p>
                    <p class="p2">As of 2019, Converse sold products through 109 company-owned retail stores in the United States and 63 stores in international markets.</p>

                    <p id="size-anim">•BUTTONED UP. Made for fall, this easy button-down was made to be layered. Cotton twill layers over the collar, button front, and front patch pockets for a classic menswear look. A woven Converse label on the left chest pocket lets them know.</p> 
                    <p id="size-anim">•BUCKLE UP. The Converse Cinch Dress takes an everyday cotton staple and flatters the fit with a belted waist. A utility buckle lets you adjust for comfort and fit, with a longer strap for style. Trimming along the sides and sleeves brings in contrast colour, along with a minimal Star Chevron logo on the right sleeve. Finished with back vent detailing to take the style all the way around.</p>
                    <p id="size-anim">•UTILITY, REIMAGINED. The Converse Lightweight Jersey Crew upgrades the fit, giving premium but breathable cotton jersey a relaxed, modern edge to take you into fall. A smaller, embroidered Converse wordmark and Star Chevron logo keeps branding minimal but elevated. Elastic cuffs pull in the oversized long sleeves, giving the roomier fit intentional style, with double drawcords at the waist for customization. It's the in-between piece you'll wear all season long.</p> 
                    <p id="size-anim">•TEAM LOLA. It's official. The Tune Squad is back in action and Converse just dropped a signature collection, including this signature Lola Bunny hoodie. The stylishly oversized design features a unique Lola Bunny action graphic on the front, bold puff print lettering on the back, and pops of pink.</p>
                    <p id="size-anim">•COURT READY. GOON READY. It's official. The Tune Squad is back in action and Converse just dropped a signature collection, including this limited-edition tee. Made for style, durability and freedom of movement, this Space Jam: A New Legacy design adds Tune Squad graphics to that fluid, court-to-street look.</p>
